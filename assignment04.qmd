start_station <- st_as_sf(cabi, coords = c("start_lng", "start_lat")) %>% 
st_set_crs(value = 4326)

dc <- states(progress_bar = FALSE) %>%
 filter(STUSPS == "DC") 

md <- counties("MD", progress_bar = FALSE) %>%
  filter(COUNTYFP == "031" | COUNTYFP == "033") 

va <- counties("VA", progress_bar = FALSE) %>%
  filter(COUNTYFP == "013" |COUNTYFP == "059" | COUNTYFP == "510")  

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = dc) +
   geom_sf(data = md) +
   geom_sf(data = va) +
  geom_sf(data = start_station,
          aes(color = member_casual)) +

day <- wday(end_time)


# Graph Total Bikeshare Trips by Day of the Week
cabi %>% 
   ggplot() +
   geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = day)) +
   labs(title = "Total Bikeshare Trips by Day of the Week", subtitle = "Capital Bikeshare, January 2023", caption = "Data Source: Capital Bikeshare") +
  xlab("Day of the Week") +
